<td><p>Namaste and thank you for sharing time with me here. This platform has a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>Emma Mildon said it best, “I am an expert in nothing and an explorer of everything.” </p>
<p>Some of the information on here may deeply resonate with you, some of it may seem far out there. </p>
<p>I have always thought that the spiritual journey is not about learning anything new,</p>
<p>but dissolving any illusions and remembering who we always were.</p> </td>

<td> <p> <b>A little about myself-</b> I grew up in a small, very friendly and safe town.</p>
<p>However, I moved to a big city in a new country, this challenged me in many ways</p>
<p> I found myself almost giving up and going back home to where it felt safe</p>
<p> It wasn't until I wondered into a yoga studio on a dull afternoon that I regained</p>
<p> my motivation and inspiration to keep persuing my dreams</p>
